# CCSpriteDraggable
A subclass for CCSprite in Cocos2D allowing you to drag sprites around the scene by interaction.
Note. After creating the sprite, you must add:
SpriteName.userInteractionEnabled = YES; 
In order to get touch events.

Code in place works on iOS, Android (using spritebuilder plugin), and Mac using mouse events.
